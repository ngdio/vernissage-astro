# Vernissage – a photo-focused theme for Eleventy

A portfolio website theme for photographers, artists, and designers using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) static site generator. The template is built upon on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com).

The theme is based on the [photography portfolio](https://github.com/JoaoFranco03/photography-portfolio) originally created by [João Franco](https://github.com/JoaoFranco03).

This theme is a work in progress and not under active development. Features such as the dynamic import of images and captioned galleries using Eleventy features are not yet supported. Feel free to send pull requests or take this project further in your own fork.
