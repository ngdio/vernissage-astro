# Vernissage – a photo-focused theme for Astro

A portfolio website theme for photographers, artists, and designers using the [Astro](https://astro.build) static site generator. The template is built upon on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [PhotoSwipe](https://photoswipe.com).

The theme is based on the [photography portfolio](https://github.com/JoaoFranco03/photography-portfolio) originally created by [João Franco](https://github.com/JoaoFranco03). I also created a template based on the same theme for Eleventy ([vernissage-11ty](https://github.com/ngdio/vernissage-11ty)).

This theme is a work in progress. Feel free to request features, send pull requests or take this project further in your own fork.
